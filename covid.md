# Graduate Climate Conference COVID-19 Protocols

The Graduate Climate Conference (GCC) is organized by graduate students, for graduate students, in order to build relationships and increase understanding and collaboration across all climate-related disciplines. To accomplish these goals, the GCC is committed to the health and well-being of our meeting attendees, and organizers. As part of our effort to hold a safe and productive meeting, the GCC recommends all registrants to make sure they are up to date with their COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. 

We advise everyone to take proper precautions when traveling to and from the conference. Please wear a mask while on an airplane or train and while in a rideshare vehicle. Wash your hands frequently, and maintain distancing when possible. The GCC organizers encourage all participants who are feeling unwell to not attend the meeting to protect their health and the health of others.


## 1.  Arrival Wellness Check

Conference attendees will be required to participate in a wellness check upon arrival for the GCC 2024. A rapid COVID-19 test will be provided by the conference organizers. Admittance to the conference will not be allowed until a negative result is shown.

## 2. Isolation Protocols

Attendees who feel ill or experience any [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html){:target="_blank"} before or during the meeting should immediately contact the GCC 2025 co-chairs Joey Rotondo (jrotondo@uw.edu), Chloe Dean (chloe.dean@whoi.edu), Fadime Stemmer (fstemmer@mit.edu). We hope to provide an isolation apartment to allow said attendee to quarantine for the remainder of the conference.

## 3. Other Onsite Safety Measures

- Masks: We will have masks available on site during oral and poster presentations, keynotes and workshops. 
- Hand sanitation stations will be available onsite for attendees.
- Self-assessment â€“ If you are feeling unwell and/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, **you should not attend**.
