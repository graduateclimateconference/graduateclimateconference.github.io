# Graduate Climate Conference COVID-19 Protocols

The Graduate Climate Conference (GCC) is organized by graduate students, for graduate students, in order to build relationships and increase understanding and collaboration across all climate-related disciplines. To accomplish these goals, the GCC is committed to the health and well-being of our meeting attendees, and organizers. As part of our effort to hold a safe and productive meeting, ___the GCC has determined that proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required for all registrants attending the GCC meeting at the Pack Forest Conference Center, Washington___. Every attendee will be required to show proof that they are fully vaccinated with a [vaccine approved for emergency use](#11-accepted-vaccines) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the World Health Organization (WHO) before being allowed to enter Pack Forest Conference Center.

Please note: The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Ffully-vaccinated.html){:target="_blank"} considers individuals to be fully vaccinated two weeks following a second dose of mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer) or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. For international attendees, this guidance applies to COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the World Health Organization (i.e., AstraZeneca/Oxford, Covishield, Sinopharm, and Sinovac) - 2 weeks after final dose.

While the CDC does not currently require individuals to receive booster shots to be fully vaccinated, we highly recommend that you receive one before traveling if you are eligible. For more information on booster eligibility, please see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html){:target="_blank"}. Finally, we advise everyone to take proper precautions when traveling to and from the conference. Please wear a mask while on an airplane or train and while in a rideshare vehicle. Wash your hands frequently, and maintain distancing when possible. 

## 1. Showing Proof of Vaccination 

Prior to arriving on site, attendees will be asked to provide proof that they are fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by FDA*. We advise that attendees also bring a copy or photo of your proof of vaccination to registration. It should clearly show which vaccine you received and the dates you received each shot. International attendees should always check current travel restrictions to the U.S. on the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html){:target="_blank"} before planning your travel to make sure you will be able to enter the U.S.

*For those unable to be vaccinated for reasons such as medical conditions or religious beliefs, a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the meeting may be substituted for vaccine proof. These attendees will also be required to complete an exemption form that must be signed by a licensed healthcare provider (MD, DO, ND, ARNP or PA).
