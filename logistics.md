# Transportation

We will provide transportation between the Boston Logan Airport and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, but we can only ensure transport for you if you are attending the entire conference. __You should receive an email assigning you to a bus. Please get on your assigned bus.__ The bus schedule will be as follows: 

### November 7th: 
- __8:30 am__: Bus from MIT to Boston Logan Airport to Woods Hole
   - Note: This bus will arrive at Boston Logan Airport around __9:00 am__ 
- __10:00 am__: Bus from Boston Logan Airport to Woods Hole

### November 9th:
- __12:30 pm__: Bus from Woods Hole to Boston Logan Airport to MIT
- __12:30 pm__: Bus from Woods Hole to Boston Logan Airport

In the event that you need to take a bus to augment these conference-provided transport options, we have found that tickets are available and cheapest via the [Peter Pan](https://peterpanbus.com/) bus line or the [Plymouth & Brockton](https://www.p-b.com/schedules/) bus line. 

__Please note__: We will arrange for buses to pick attendees up at Boston Logan Airport, so no one except those local to the area should need to make their way to MIT to recieve transport. However, in the event that it is necessary, you can use the MBTA (referred to as the “T”), which includes the subway, bus and commuter rail system in Boston, to make your way to the MIT campus. The OpenMBTA smartphone app is a great way to track bus/subway arrival and departure times when using public transportation in Boston. The MIT campus is located at the Kendall/MIT stop on the Red Line of the subway system.

# Meals
We’ve shared a list of attendees with dietary needs (e.g., allergies, vegan, gluten-free, lactose intolerance, etc.) with the Marine Biological Laboratory dining staff. _If you requested a special meal, please identify yourself to the kitchen staff at each meal to ensure you receive the meal prepared specifically for you._

As a reminder, all meals served at the conference will be **vegetarian.** The dining team is familiar with our group and will do their best to accommodate any additional requests as needed. If you feel you will need more protein than provided, please bring your own. Personal snacks are welcome and encouraged!

# Post-Conference 
To wrap up the weekend, the organizing committee has compiled a [list of activities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vsks3KDjsjwmXlmeFhQywaO6x1hjIrLzXMH9TUAqQns/edit) for a **self-guided** and **attendee-organized** social afternoon in Boston. Explore the city with new friends, enjoy some great food, and celebrate the close of another incredible GCC! Feel free to use the WhatsApp group to coordinate with other attendees.


<!--# How to get to MIT’s campus for the bus
You can take a cab from Boston Logan Airport or the South Station train/bus terminal, which will cost about $40 and take 20-30 minutes in all cases. Uber and Lyft can be slightly cheaper, depending on demand. If you are planning to take a cab or Uber/Lyft from Boston Logan Airport to MIT and would like to coordinate shared rides with other attendees, please enter your information on the spreadsheet link provided in the final logistics email and use the sheet to contact other attendees.

Alternatively, you can take the MBTA (referred to as the “T”) which includes the subway, bus and commuter rail system in Boston. 
<h4> How to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT using the T: </h4>
The best way to get to MIT from the airport is to catch the free Silver Line bus from outside the lower level (baggage claim) of each terminal. This bus provides a free transfer into the subway system at South Station, from which point you can catch the Red Line to Kendall/MIT (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife, exit four stops later). Plan at least an hour to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT’s campus on the silver and red lines.

<h4> How to get from the South Station bus/train terminals to MIT using the T: </h4>
Those arriving via train or bus will have to purchase a farecard (<3$) to board the Red Line subway at South Station (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife). Get off four stops later at the Kendall/MIT station. Budget half an hour to get from South Station to MIT’s campus.-->

    <h1>Accomodations</h1>
    <p>Conference participants will be staying in historical cabins. Each cabin sleeps up to eight people. Restrooms and showers are located in a building across from the cabins (see map for details). Pack Forest provides towels and bedding for all participants.</p>
    <h3>What to Bring</h3>
    <p>Here is a reminder of what to bring with you: toiletries, a refillable water bottle, a headlamp (recommended), warm clothes, a rain jacket, a halloween costume, and your poster (if relevant). Bedding and towels will be provided, but some of the accommodations are a short walk away from the communal showers. You will be staying in cabins with 8 people in them, so you may want to bring ear plugs with you if you are a light sleeper!</p>
