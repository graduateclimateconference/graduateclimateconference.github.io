# Location

GCC 2025 will be on November 7 - 9, 2025 at the [Marine Biological Laboratory](https://www.mbl.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The drive between Woods Hole and Boston is approximately 1.5 hours. Transportation between Boston and Woods Hole will be provided. Please email [gradclimateconference@gmail.com](mailto:gradclimateconference@gmail.com) for any inquries. Thank you!

# Transportation

We will provide transportation between Boston and Woods Hole, but we can only ensure transport for you if you are attending the entire conference. Unless you choose to drive yourself, you will be taking a bus from MIT’s campus to MBL, which should take about 1h 45min.

# How to get to MIT’s campus for the bus
You can take a cab from Boston Logan Airport or the South Station train/bus terminal, which will cost about $40 and take 20-30 minutes in all cases. Uber and Lyft can be slightly cheaper, depending on demand. If you are planning to take a cab or Uber/Lyft from Boston Logan Airport to MIT and would like to coordinate shared rides with other attendees, please enter your information on the spreadsheet link provided in the final logistics email and use the sheet to contact other attendees.

Alternatively, you can take the MBTA (referred to as the “T”) which includes the subway, bus and commuter rail system in Boston. The OpenMBTA smartphone app is a great way to track bus/subway arrival and departure times when using public transportation in Boston. The MIT campus is located at the Kendall/MIT stop on the Red Line of the subway system.

<h4> How to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT using the T: </h4>
The best way to get to MIT from the airport is to catch the free Silver Line bus from outside the lower level (baggage claim) of each terminal. This bus provides a free transfer into the subway system at South Station, from which point you can catch the Red Line to Kendall/MIT (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife, exit four stops later). Plan at least an hour to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT’s campus on the silver and red lines.

<h4> How to get from the South Station bus/train terminals to MIT using the T: </h4>
Those arriving via train or bus will have to purchase a farecard (<3$) to board the Red Line subway at South Station (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife). Get off four stops later at the Kendall/MIT station. Budget half an hour to get from South Station to MIT’s campus.

    <h1>Accomodations</h1>
    <p>Conference participants will be staying in historical cabins. Each cabin sleeps up to eight people. Restrooms and showers are located in a building across from the cabins (see map for details). Pack Forest provides towels and bedding for all participants.</p>
    <h3>What to Bring</h3>
    <p>Here is a reminder of what to bring with you: toiletries, a refillable water bottle, a headlamp (recommended), warm clothes, a rain jacket, a halloween costume, and your poster (if relevant). Bedding and towels will be provided, but some of the accommodations are a short walk away from the communal showers. You will be staying in cabins with 8 people in them, so you may want to bring ear plugs with you if you are a light sleeper!</p>
