# Session types and expectations at the GCC:
## Oral presentation: 
Oral presentations will be delivered exclusively to attendees of the Graduate Climate Conference during dedicated sessions. Each session will consist of 4-6 speakers. Individual presentations should be 10-12 minutes in length, followed by 3-5 minutes for questions and discussion. The audience will comprise graduate-level climate scientists representing a broad range of disciplines; accordingly, presenters are encouraged to minimize the use of technical jargon and prioritize clear, accessible communication.

## Internal poster: 
Poster sessions will take place in a traditional poster hall and will be organized thematically. Posters must not exceed 42" x 60" in portrait orientation. The audience will consist of graduate-level climate scientists from a wide range of disciplines; therefore, presenters are encouraged to limit technical jargon and emphasize clarity and accessibility.

## Lightning talks: 
Lightning talks will be delivered to a public audience that includes both scientists and members of the broader community. Each session will feature five speakers, with individual presentations lasting three minutes, followed by two minutes for questions and discussion. Presentations should be accessible to a wide range of familiarity levels, ensuring clarity for those with little or no prior knowledge while remaining engaging to scientific audiences. All lightning talk presenters are also invited to present an internal poster at the conference (see section above).

## Public poster: 
Public poster sessions will be open to an audience that includes both scientists and members of the broader community. Presentations should be designed to engage a wide range of familiarity levels, from professional expertise to little or no prior knowledge. Posters must not exceed 42" x 60" in portrait orientation.

# Oral Presentations

[Abstracts](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2024_abstracts.pdf)

As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending.

Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving. -->
