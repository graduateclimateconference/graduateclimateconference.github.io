<!--[Abstracts](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2024_abstracts.pdf)-->

# Session types and expectations at the GCC:
## Oral presentation: 
Oral presentations will be delivered exclusively to attendees of the Graduate Climate Conference during dedicated sessions. Each session will consist of 4-6 speakers. Individual presentations should be 10-12 minutes in length, followed by 3-5 minutes for questions and discussion. The audience will comprise graduate-level climate scientists representing a broad range of disciplines; accordingly, presenters are encouraged to minimize the use of technical jargon and prioritize clear, accessible communication.

## Internal poster: 
Poster sessions will take place in a traditional poster hall and will be organized thematically. Posters must not exceed 42" x 60" in portrait orientation. The audience will consist of graduate-level climate scientists from a wide range of disciplines; therefore, presenters are encouraged to limit technical jargon and emphasize clarity and accessibility.

## Lightning talks: 
Lightning talks will be delivered to a public audience that includes both scientists and members of the broader community. Each session will feature five speakers, with individual presentations lasting three minutes, followed by two minutes for questions and discussion. Presentations should be accessible to a wide range of familiarity levels, ensuring clarity for those with little or no prior knowledge while remaining engaging to scientific audiences. All lightning talk presenters are also invited to present an internal poster at the conference (see section above).

## Public poster: 
Public poster sessions will be open to an audience that includes both scientists and members of the broader community. Presentations should be designed to engage a wide range of familiarity levels, from professional expertise to little or no prior knowledge. Posters must not exceed 42" x 60" in portrait orientation.

# Oral Presentations

[Abstracts](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2024_abstracts.pdf)

As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending.

Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving. --> 

# Keynote Speakers

__Dr. Hilary Palevsky__
> Title: Surviving and Thriving in a World in Crisis: Tales from an Academic Climate Science Career
Hilary is an Assistant Professor in the Boston College Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. Her research centers on the ocean’s role in global biogeochemical cycling, with a particular focus on understanding how the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key influence on global climate and ongoing climate change. To address these questions, her research group conducts fieldwork to deploy and calibrate autonomous biogeochemical sensors, measures samples in the laboratory, and analyzes data from sensors deployed in the field, often together with complimentary datasets such as from satellite remote sensing and global climate model simulations. She also teaches classes on ocean and climate science from the undergraduate through graduate levels, and considers it essential to her scientific and educational role to work to build a more inclusive, supportive, and equitable scientific community and world.

Before beginning her current position in 2019, she was a Lecturer at Wellesley College, a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and received her PhD in Oceanography and a graduate certificate in Climate Science at the University of Washington. Prior to beginning her graduate studies, she earned a B.A. in Geology from Amherst College, spent a year studying North Atlantic cod fisheries as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow and taught marine science on traditionally-rigged schooners in Long Island Sound. She lives in the Boston area with her (academic) spouse, their 1-year-old baby, three cats, and a very good dog


__Dr. Marcela Loría Salazar__
> Title: Bridging the Gap: Advancing Aerosol Research in the Understudied Central U.S.
Marcela Loria Salazar is an Assistant Professor in the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, where she leads interdisciplinary research on atmospheric processes that shape air composition. Her work addresses emissions from urban areas, wildfires, prescribed burns, agriculture, and dust, with a strong emphasis on advancing air quality forecasting and exposure assessments.

Dr. Loria Salazar is recognized for her innovative integration of aerosol and gas-phase measurements, satellite remote sensing, meteorological data, numerical modeling, deep learning, and big data assimilation. Her collaborative approach has positioned her as a key contributor to major national and international initiatives, including NASA’s PACE Mission Early Adopter Program, NOAA’s Pathfinders Initiative, CIWRO, and the SPARTAN Global Network.
As a leader in her field, she plays a pivotal role in efforts to improve smoke behavior prediction, including serving on a national initiative led by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Her research has earned prestigious recognition, including the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship and awards from the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Oklahoma.

Dr. Loria Salazar holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Nevada, Reno, and a B.S. in Meteorology from the Universidad de Costa Rica. She is dedicated to promoting inclusive scientific collaboration and driving innovation to enhance environmental health and resilience
