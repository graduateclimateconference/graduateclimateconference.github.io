# Oral Presentations

[Abstracts](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2024_abstracts.pdf)

As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending.

Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving. -->
