# Oral Presentations

<!--[Abstracts](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2024_abstracts.pdf)-->

As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending.

Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving.

# Keynote Speakers

__Dr. Hannah Zanowski__
> Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice Keynote Speaker
Dr. Hannah Zanowski is an Assistant Professor in the department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the Program Director and co-PI of the Student Training in Remote Sensing and Meteorology (STORM) REU program. She grew up in a furnace (Arizona), and now lives in a freezer (Wisconsin), but tried out several states in between. Her early research was in Antarctic ocean modeling during her Ph.D. at Princeton University as well as part of her postdoctoral work at the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO; now CICOES) at the University of Washington. She also completed a postdoc with Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado Boulder where she explored present and future Arctic freshwater transport and storage, the deglacial Pacific Ocean circulation, and the formation of Pikialasorsuaq (the North Water polynya) during the mid-Holocene. She uses coupled climate models to understand the physical oceanography of Earth’s polar regions and how changes in these regions are communicated to and transported in the abyssal ocean. Additionally, she is interested in understanding the physical oceanography of early Earth as well as ocean circulation on exoplanets.


__Dr. Marysa Laguë__
> Early Career Scientist Keynote Speaker
Dr. Marysa Lague is an Assistant Professor in the Geography department at the University of British Columbia. Her research focuses on understanding how terrestrial processes impact the atmosphere and surface climate from the scale of a single plant to the scale of a planet, by modulating fluxes of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere. Dr. Lague completed her PhD in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, where she also completed MSc degrees in both Atmospheric Sciences and Applied Mathematics. She was a James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Dynamic and Multiscale Systems at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the University of Saskatchewan’s Coldwater Lab. In her work, she uses models of varied complexity to test how individual land-surface properties modify energy and water fluxes to the atmosphere, and how those flux changes in turn impact atmospheric dynamics and climate, both locally and in regions far away from the initial land change. The overarching goal of her research program is to understand where the atmosphere is sensitive to changes in the land surface, what particular properties of the land surface modulate climate, and how continentality influences the coupled global climate system. -->
