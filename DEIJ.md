# Graduate Climate Conference Commitment to a Supportive and Accessible Community

The Graduate Climate Conference (GCC) is dedicated to fostering a welcoming and supportive environment for all participants. We believe that bringing together individuals from a wide range of backgrounds strengthens our community and enhances scientific discussions. Our goal is to create a space where all attendees feel encouraged to share their research and perspectives in a respectful and engaging setting.
 
To ensure a broad participation, the GCC will:

- Actively reach out to geoscience departments at traditionally underrepresented universities at the conference to share information about the conference and provide application support.
- Conduct a blind review of all applications by at least two committee members to promote a fair selection process.
- Establish clear guidelines for professional and respectful conduct, as outlined in the GCC Code of Conduct. All participants will be expected to review and agree to these expectations in advance.
- Organize keynote sessions and discussions on topics relevant to the climate science community, including ways to broaden participation in the field.
- Offer participatory workshops that cover a range of topics, including those relevant to building a strong and collaborative research community.
- Gather feedback through a post-conference survey to evaluate the event and identify opportunities for improvement in future years.

Additionally, the GCC will monitor participation demographics to ensure a representative applicant pool. While applications will be reviewed anonymously, we will assess final participation trends and refine our approach as needed. Moderators will work to ensure a productive discussion environment during Q&A sessions.

By taking these steps, the GCC aims to create an engaging and productive space where all attendees feel valued and able to fully participate in conference activities.


# Keynote Speakers at the GCC

The GCC will feature two keynote speakers: one who will explore ways to broaden participation and engagement in climate science, and another early-career scientist who will share insights on diverse career paths in research, academia, science communication, and beyond.
