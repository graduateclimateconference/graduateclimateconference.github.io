# Code of Conduct
The Graduate Climate Conference (GCC) is organized by graduate students, for graduate students, in order to build relationships and increase understanding and collaboration across all climate-related disciplines. To accomplish these goals, we have set the following ground rules, based on the [American Geophysical Union’s Scientific Integrity and Professional Ethics policy](https://www.agu.org/Learn-About-AGU/About-AGU/Ethics), to ensure a meaningful and comfortable conference experience for all. 

## I. Expected Behavior 
- Treat all GCC participants and any individuals associated with the GCC with respect and consideration. Recognize value in diversity of backgrounds and perspectives.
- Interact in a considerate, respectful, and collaborative manner. Communicate openly and with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.
- Present your research findings accurately and objectively, acknowledging those who made significant contributions to your research. Respect others’ requests for confidentiality during presentations of new or unpublished research.
- Meet new people! Consider reaching out to people you don’t know whose talk, e-poster and/or workshop you enjoyed.

## II. Unacceptable Behavior 
- Harassment (including sexual and gender harassment), bullying, physical or verbal abuse, or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated.
- Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to: 
  - Verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, or socioeconomic class; 
  - Harassment or intimidation by words, gestures, body language, or any menacing behavior; 
  - Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations; 
  - Threatening or stalking any GCC participant, student host, staff member, or other individual associated with the GCC.
 
## III. Consequences 
Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. The GCC organizing team may take any action deemed appropriate, including immediate removal. We reserve the right to prohibit attendance at any future GCC.

## IV. Reporting 
If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify the GCC organizing team (gradclimateconference@gmail.com) or any of the GCC co-chairs individually: 
- Fadime Stemmer (fadime.stemmer@who.edu)
- Chloe Dean (chloe.dean@whoi.edu)
- Joey Rotondo (jrotondo@uw.edu)
